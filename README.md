## Development

To start contributing to the packages, all you need to do is installing dependencies and running `dev` script. This will build & watch the all packages including the web app.

```sh
yarn install
yarn dev
```

You'll see that the packages are got built and lastly the web app started running on `3000` port. You can open the `localhost:3000` and start testing the client and hooks.

Once you make changes to any of the packages, it'll re-build them again and web app will be refreshed.
